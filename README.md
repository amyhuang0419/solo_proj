Sneakers Survey Platform

Guangyu Huang- Solo Project Proposal

Description: The website is going to create a platform for people who like sneakers. They can upload the information of their sneakers collections. Other people who create the account (Be one of the user) can like or unlike sneakers, and everyone can leave a comment for the sneakers to improve communication between different collectors. It can figures out the current sneakers market, explores the future market.

Extension of the website could be let the collectors or users to sell or buy the sneakers which they prefer, they can also bit the price. ( I will try on it if I have enough time, but I will focus on the sneakers survey first).

New stuff that I am going to explore:

Save different images for different sneakers in the database
Set up the purchase system (workable in the real life)
Collect the sell and buy records (need to explore, have no idea right now)
Minimum Viable Product:

Home page shows the images of some sneakers. And ask new customer to register and login page. Or they can view the sneakers information and rate as guest. (home.html)
Register and login page, which the new custom who wants to register or the current user who wants to login (register_login.html)
User's own page, it can display the sneakers information and also the comment which the user left for different sneakers. User can link to the create new sneaker page, and user can also link to edit page or delete the sneakers or the comments which he left. (user.html)
Top survey page, this page can be view by customers or guests. This include the current surveys for different collectors and sneakers which include rates. (surveys.html)
Sneakers page, this page include the collector's information who upload the sneakers as collections. Also it include the comments from different users. And users can like or unlike the sneakers or comments, guest must to sign up an account. (sneakers.html)
Edit page, the login user can edit the sneakers information and update it. Or delete the sneakers (edit.html)
New sneakers page, this page ask login user to create a new sneaker collection. (new_sneaker.html)
Product Backlog:

Login user can bit or purchase the sneakers if the price match. (in the "Sneakers page")
if user choose purchase now, there's a link to the purchase page(purchase_now.html)
if user bit, there's a link to the bit page and change bits. And login user can look at the highest bit now. New stuff, how to set up the purchase process when the bit matches. (bit_page)
NEW!! The page of sneakers purchase page. Like when the users purchase the sneaker and what's the price they purchased.
